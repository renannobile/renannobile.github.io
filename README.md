This is my webpage, a page meant to tell you, the reader, a few things about me, mostly professionally. Something like a portfolio of sorts.

## Tools used in development
The page is simple HTML + CSS and a little Javascript. I have used [Bulma](https://bulma.io) for the layout, it's a simple yet BEATIFUL ~~much more than Bootstrap~~ CSS library, that really helps and speeds up development.

Since it's an HTML page, [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) was used to serve it, which includes hot reload and CSS/Js watch. Really useful package.
