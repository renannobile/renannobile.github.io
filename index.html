                  <p>
                    Before starting a professional career, I studied Informatics
                    at the
                    <a href="https://www.etecpg.com.br/" target="_blank">Technical School of Praia Grande (ETEC)</a>,
                    a technical course that gave me a solid basis to start
                    development.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    To me, this was the place that opened my mind to technology
                    and to use the computer as something more than just
                    entertainment.
                  </p>

                    After getting the technical degree and finishing high
                    school, I joined the <a href="http://fatecpg.edu.br/" target="_blank">College of Technology of Praia Grande (FATEC)</a>,
                    enrolled in the System Analisys and Development course for a
                    technological degree.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This course provided theoretical knowledge of requirements
                    gathering, database modeling, project management,
                    administration, communication, finances and several other
                    disciplines.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    As part of the graduation project, me and my colleague
                    developed a plataform that allows users to book and rent
                    board games like Monopoly, War, RPGs and much more, directly
                    from 'hosts' that have these games and are willing to share
                    it.

                      Now, before I tell you about my experiences, I would like to talk a litte
                      about my interaction with Javascript and it's current state.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Firstly, it's an amazing language and definetely the one I have the
                      most experience with. The 'javascript' developer role started in
                      November of 2016, when I started writting an Ionic app for the company
                      I was working on. Now, I say 'javascript' because the environment is
                      much bigger than just javascript. It involves HTML, CSS, frameworks,
                      libraries, Node, Webpack, Cordova and a lot of documentation reading.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      During these two years, I learned how to use functions from ES6, ES7
                      and can say that I'm prepared for ES8 up to ES-whatever-comes-next. I
                      can now understand the principles and concepts behind some frameworks,
                      specially <b>Angular</b>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I look forward to see what Javascript will become in the following years,
                      and how it will adapt in this ever-changing ecossystem of web development.

                            Google's Play Store by the end of January 2017. After the app was deployed and
                            the success we had, another Angular web app was created.

                  Avanade is a big tech company, a joint venture between Accenture and Microsoft.
                  Our main objective is to build high quality, scalable and maintanable applications
                  for our clients. For this reason, I was allocated on the client, a bank that

                  This is a real professional landmark for me, because it meant working in a different
                  city, in a much bigger and dynamic place from what I was used to. I was really proud
                  of myself for getting here.

                <p>
                  On my first project I acted as an Integration developer using IBM Integration Bus
                  and Zup API Manager. When coupled, these tools allowed us to communicate with the
                  Mainframe through a REST api, which was translated into SOAP request and transformed
                  again into something that the backend could understand, without too much fuss or
                  time wasted on creating a complex architecture.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When the team finished that project, we began to develope an Angular application,
                  revamping the customer onboarding experience.

                  A couple of months later, I was moved to another team. This time, we were creating a
                  product from scratch. Using Angular and the integration tools, we achieved the
                  expectations and delivered a quality app.

                <p>
                  Still on the same team, we are now close to deliver a new module of the application,
                  meant to be used by a different public target.
